                    For students, the number mesh problem is and always has been queues. In the average six-hour college day, that hour of lunchtime break students get doesnâ€™t feel that long. The last thing students want to do is spend their precious time away from classes, standing in an overly long queue. There are friends to talk to, footballs to be kicked, or maybe even lunchtime clubs and groups to attend.Also the cleanliness and satitation around the canteen is found as an issuse running around students head.
