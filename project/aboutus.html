    <h4>A Brief Introduction:</h4>
    <p id = "p01"> Kathmandu University has maintained its legacy as a centre of excellence since its humble beginnings in 1991. It primarily focuses on imparting quality education to all the citizens of Nepal. KU is a place for innovation, learning, discovery, expression and discourse. Every year, KU welcomes more than 2000 students from every conceivable geographic division, socio-economic background and future career choices from all over the country. We educate students with the objective that after their rigorous years here, they will be better able to observe, understand, experiment and produce significant results  and become true global citizens. To meet the essential requirements for strengthening the quality of its programs, KU is in the process of further developing its own infrastructure and services to maintain global standards and sophistication. With the support of a full-time dedicated faculty and staff, the institution has been capable to impart quality education to more than 2500 students every year. KU places student success at the heart of everything it does. Affordability and equity, have been, and will always be the cornerstones of KU. It’s a concept well off the beaten path in an educational landscape of rising tuition fees and widespread academic commercialization, but we truly believe this has worked in our and the students benefit.
