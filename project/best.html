    <h2>Is Kathmandu University Best university in Nepal?</h2>
<p id = "p01">Kathamandu University is without a doubt is one of the prestigious university in Nepal. But with Trivhuvan University standing with their glourious history of providing quality education, students of KU always has that one thing running throught their mind:<b>"Is KU best in Nepal?"</b> Both of the university have their history and their aluminai all round the world.It is not necessary that a university must be best or at top level. A university's level is reflected by the quality of students, quality of graduates and the help provided by its graduates in developing the country.Students of KU are being able to continuosly provide the qualitative results and our graduates are able to reflect their quality all around the world.It is the resposibility of student to flourish University as best and KU's student are doing it perfectly.

<h2>Projects in KU</h2>
                <p id = "p01">
        The reason why Kathmandu University is being able to produce best graduates is the project task that must be handled by every student according to field of their study. Here students  must be involved in any project based on their own idea and deliver their idea in best possible way.Projects here are done by students without major aid of faculty.University provide a platform for student to deliver their vision and knowdlege through the projects.
