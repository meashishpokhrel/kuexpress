1
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,182
Whoa,
there!

2
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,319
Halt!

3
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,197
Who goes there?

4
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:44,623
It is I, Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon,
from the castle of Camelot.

5
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,879
King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons

6
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,711
Sovereign of all England!

7
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,635
Pull the other one.

8
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,010
I am, and this is my trusty servant, Patsy.

9
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,884
We have ridden the length of the land
in search of knights

10
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:05,894
who will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.

11
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,859
-What? Ridden on a horse?
-Yes.

12
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,232
-You’re using coconuts!
-What?

13
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,236
You’ve got two empty halves of coconut,
and you’re banging them together.

14
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:19,240
So? We have ridden since
the snows of winter covered this land.

15
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,331
-Through the Kingdom of Mercia.
-Where did you get the coconuts?

16
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,623
We found them.

17
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,919
Found them? In Mercia? The coconut is tropical.

18
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,089
-What do you mean?
-Well, this is a temperate zone.

19
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,839
The swallow may fly south with the sun,
or the house martin or the plover

20
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,264
may seek warmer climes in winter,
yet these are not strangers to our land.

21
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:45,184
-Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
-Not at all. They could be carried.

22
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,984
-What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
-It could grip it by the husk.

23
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:55,280
It’s not a question of where he grips it! It’s a simple question of weight ratio. I

24
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,948
A five-ounce bird could not carry
a one-pound coconut.

25
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:04,953
It doesn’t matter. Go tell your master
that Arthur from Camelot is here.

26
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,578
In order to maintain air-speed velocity,

27
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,462
a swallow needs to beat its wings
43 times every second, right?

28
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,460
Please!
-Am I right?

29
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,549
-I'm not interested.
-It could be carried by an African swallow.

30
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:26,891
Oh, yes! An African swallow, maybe.
Not a European swallow. That’s my point.

31
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,222
I agree with that.

32
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:32,651
Will you ask your master
if he wants to join my court at Camelot?

33
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:36,697
But then, of course,
African swallows are non-migratory.

34
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,991
Oh, yes.
They couIdnt bring a coconut, anyway.

35
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,245
Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows
carried it together?

36
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:49,535
-No, they’d have to have it on a line.
-Simple. They’d use a strand of creeper.

37
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,380
-Held under the dorsal guiding feathers?
Why not?

38
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,837
Bring out your dead!

39
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:29,824
Ninepence.

40
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,809
-Bring out your dead.
-Here's one.

41
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,147
Ninepence.

42
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,816
-I’m not dead! 
-What?

43
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,565
-Nothing. Here’s your ninepence.
-I’m not dead!

44
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,897
-He says he’s not dead.
-Yes, he is.

45
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,482
not!
-He isn’t?

46
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,158
-He will be soon. He’s very ill.
-I’m getting better!

47
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,986
You’ll be stone dead in a moment

48
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,743
I can’t take him like that. It’s against regulations.

49
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,167
-I don’t want to go on the cart.
-Don’t be such a baby.

50
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,415
-I can’t take him.
-l feel fine.

51
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,542
-Well, do us a favor.
I can’t.

52
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,249
Can you hang around a few minutes?
He won’t be long.

53
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,051
Got to go to the Robinsons.
They’ve lost nine today.

54
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,925
-When’s your next round?
-Thursday.

55
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,759
-l think I’ll go for a walk.
-You’re not fooling anyone, you know.

56
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:32,813
-Isn’t there something you can do?
-I feel happy.

57
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,150
-Thanks very much.
-Not at all. See you on Thursday.

58
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,317
Right.

59
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,196
-Who’s that, then?
-I don’t know. Must be a king.

60
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,077
-Why?
-He hasn’t got shit all over him.

61
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,595
-Old woman!
-Man!

62
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:17,479
Man. Sorry.
What knight lives in that castle over there?

63
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,852
-I’m 37.
-What?

64
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:23,989
-I’m 37. I’m not old.
-I can’t just call you “man.”

65
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,068
-You could say “Dennis.”
-I didn’t know you were called Dennis.

66
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,823
You didn’t bother to find out.

67
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,655
I did say sorry about the “old woman,’
but from behind...

68
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,992
What I object to
is that you treat me like an inferior.

69
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,995
-Well, I am king.
-King? Very nice

70
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,422
How did you get that?
By exploiting the workers!

71
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,256
By hanging on to outdated
imperialist dogma which perpetuates

72
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,339
the economic and social differences
in our societyl

73
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:52,927
-If there’s ever going to be any progress.
-There’s some lovely filth down here.

74
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,185
How do you do?

75
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,265
How do you do, good lady?
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

76
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,771
-Whose castle is that?
-King of the who?

77
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,023
-The Britons.
-Who are the Britons?

78
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,273
We all are. We’re all Britons.
And l am your king.

79
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:10,197
Didn’t know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective.

80
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:13,120
You’re fooling yourself.
We’re living in a dictatorship.

81
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,291
A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working class...

82
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,869
There you go. Bringing class into it again

83
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:23,458
-That’s what it’s all about. If only people...
-Please, good people. I am in haste.

84
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,750
Who lives in that castle?

85
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,424
-No one lives there -Who is your lord?

86
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,471
-We don’t have a lord.
-What?

87
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,721
I told you.
We’re an anarcho-syndicalist commune.

88
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:37,308
We take turns to act as
a sort of executive officer for the week.

89
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,981
Yes.
-But all the decisions of that officer

90
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:43,060
-are ratified at a biweekly meeting.
-Yes, I see.

91
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,484
-By a majority in the case of internal affairs.
-Be quietl

92
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,989
-By a two-thirds majority in the case of.
-Be quietr I order you to be quiet.

93
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,495
“Order.” Who does he think he is’

94
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:56,198
-I am your king!
-I didn’t vote for you.

95
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:59,751
-You don’t vote for kings.
-How did you become king then?

96
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,132
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,

97
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:08,502
held aloft Excalibur
from the bosom of the water,

98
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:14,012
signifying, by divine providence,
that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.

99
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,009
That is why I’m your king!

100
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,598
Listen. Strange women lying in ponds,
distributing swords, is no basis

101
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,022
for a system of government. Supreme executive power

102
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:28,697
derives from a mandate from the masses. Not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

103
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:29,863
Be quiet!

104
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,034
You can’t expect to wield supreme executive power

105
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,703
‘cause some watery tart threw a sword at you.

106
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,032
-Shut up!
-If I went around saying I was an emperor

107
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:43,416
because some moistened bint had lobbed
a scimitar at me, they’d put me away!

108
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,624
-Will you shut up?
-See the violence inherent in the system.

109
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:51,385
-Shut up!
-See the violence inherent in the system!

110
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,548
-Help, I’m being repressed!
-Bloody peasant!

111
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,054
What a giveaway. Did you hear that?

112
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,228
That’s what Im on about.
Did you see him repressing me?

113
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,074
You fight with the strength of many men,
Sir Knight.

114
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,412
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.

115
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:54,252
I seek the finest and bravest knights in the land to join me in Camelot.

116
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,059
You have proved yourself worthy.
Will you join me?

117
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,776
You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.

118
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,774
None shall pass.

119
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,239
-What? 
-None shall pass.

120
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,653
I have no quarrel with you, good
Sir Knight, but I must cross this bridge.

121
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,954
Then you shall die.

122
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:27,792
I command you, as King of the Britons,
to stand aside.

123
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,671
I move for no man.

124
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:34,673
So be it!

125
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,495
Now, stand aside, worthy adversary.

126
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,789
-‘Tis but a scratch.
-‘'A scratch”? Your arms off.

127
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,284
-No, it isn’t.
-Well, what’s that, then?

128
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,836
-I’ve had worse.
-You liar.

129
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,538
Come on, you pansy!

130
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,964
Victory is mine.

131
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,972
We thank thee, Lord, that in thy..

132
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,854
-Come on, then.
-What?

133
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,396
Have at you.

134
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,568
You are brave, Sir Knight,
but the fight is mine.

135
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,236
Had enough, eh?

136
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,815
Look, you stupid bastard. You’ve got no arms left.

137
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,366
-Yes, I have.
-Look!

138
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,277
Just a flesh wound.

139
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,784
-Look, stop that.
-Chicken!

140
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,367
Ill have your leg. Right!

141
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,580
-Right! Ill do you for that.
-You’ll what?

142
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,587
-Come here.
-What are you going to do? Bleed on me?

143
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,419
-I am invincible!
-You’re a loony.

144
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,845
The Black Knight always triumphs.
Have at you!

145
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,135
Come on, then.

146
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,483
All right, we’ll call it a draw.

147
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,815
-Come, Patsy.
-Oh, I see.

148
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,899
Running away? You yellow bastard!

149
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:27,370
Come back here and take what’s coming
to you! I’ll bite your legs off!

150
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:34,878
Pie Jesu Domine

151
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,875
Dona els requiem

152
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,176
Pie Jesu Domine

153
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:52,770
Dona els requiem

154
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,947
-A witch!
-We found a witch.

155
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,284
-We got a witch!
-We found a witch.

156
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,584
We’ve got a witch.

157
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,996
Burn her!

158
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,263
-We have found a witch. May we burn her?
-Burn her!

159
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,022
-How do you know she is a witch?
-She looks like one.

160
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,525
Bring her forward.

161
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,735
-I am not a witch.
-But you are dressed as one.

162
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,905
-They dressed me up like this.
-We didn’t!

163
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,578
And this isn’t my nose. It’s a false one.

164
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,368
-Well?
-Well, we did do the nose.

165
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,080
-The nose?
-And the hat. But she is a witch.

166
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,378
Burn her!

167
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,429
-Did you dress her up like this?
-No. Yes.

168
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:12,092
Yes, a bit. She has got a wart.

169
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,639
-What makes you think she is a witch?
-Well, she turned me into a newt.

170
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,224
A newt?

171
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,772
I got better.

172
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:28,696
-Burn her anyway.
-Burn her!

173
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:37,284
Quiet! There are ways of telling
whether she is a witch.

174
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:41,413
-Are there? What are they? Tell us.
-Do they hurt?

175
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,795
Tell me, what do you do with witches?

176
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,335
Burn them!

177
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,174
-What do you burn apart from witches?
-More witches1

178
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,011
-Wood.
-So, why do witches burn?

179
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,030
-‘Cause they’re made of wood?
-Good.

180
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,580
So, how do we tell
whether she is made of wood?

181
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:22,420
-Build a bridge out of her.
-Can you not also make bridges of stone?

182
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:24,710
Oh, yeah.

183
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,209
Does wood sink in water?

184
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:31,011
-No.
-It floats.

185
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,805
Throw her into the pond!

186
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,936
-What also floats in water?
-Bad.

187
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,847
-Apples. 
-Very small rocks.

188
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,980
-Cider. Cherries. 
-Gravy. Mud.

189
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,236
-Churches.
-Lead.

190
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,483
A duck!

191
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,903
Exactly.

192
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,361
So, logically...

193
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,488
If she

194
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,662
weighs the same as a duck...

195
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,712
Shes made of wood.

196
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,255
And, therefore...

197
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,925
-A witch!
-A witch!

198
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,849
We shall use my largest scales

199
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:40,706
Right. Remove the supports!

200
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,087
-A witch!
-A witch!

201
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,795
-It’s a fair cop.
-Burn her!

202
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:01,056
Who are you,
who are so wise in the ways of science?

203
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,518
-I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
-My liege.

204
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,862
Good Sir Knight, will you come to Camelot,
and join us at the Round Table?

205
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,531
My liege, I would be honored.

206
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,742
-What is your name?
-Bedevere, my liege.

207
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,912
Then I dub you Sir Bedevere,

208
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,703
knight of the Round Table.

209
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,958
The wise Sir Bedevere was the first
to join King Arthur’s knights.

210
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:30,916
But other illustrious names
were soon to follow.

211
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:33,255
Sir Lancelot the Brave.

212
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,969
Sir Galahad the Pure.

213
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,758
And Sir Robin,
the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot,

214
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,093
who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor

215
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:45,271
Iwho had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol,

216
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:49,101
and who had personally wet himself
at the Battle of Badon Hill.

217
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,820
And the aptly named
Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.

218
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,948
Together they formed a band

219
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,869
whose names and deeds
were to be retold throughout the centuries.

220
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,408
The Knights of the Round Table.

221
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,497
That, my liege, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shared.

222
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,044
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere!

223
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,965
Explain again how sheep’s bladders
may be employed to prevent earthquakes.

224
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,088
-Certainly, sin.
-Look, my liege.

225
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,931
-Camelot.
-Camelot.

226
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,138
-Camelot.
-Its only a model.

227
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,513
Knights, I bid you welcome
to your new home.

228
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:30,270
Let us ride to Camelot!

229
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:35,401
We’re knights of the Round Table  
We dance whene’er we’re able

230
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,574
We do routines and chorus scenes
With footwork impeccable

231
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,949
We dine well here in Camelot
We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot

232
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,960
We’re knights of the Round Table
Our shows are formidable

233
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:55,462
But many times
We’re given rhymes

234
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,420
That are quite unsingable 
We’re opera mad in Camelot

235
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,675
sing from the diaphragm a lot

236
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,197
In war we’re tough and able

237
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,242
Quite indefatigable

238
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,903
Between our quests 
We sequin vests

239
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:27,206
And impersonate Clark Gable
It’s a busy life in Camelot

240
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:31,623
I have to push the pram a lot

241
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,002
No, on second thoughts,
let’s not go to Camelot. It is a silly place.

242
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,337
Right.

243
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,850
Arthur.

244
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:55,776
King of the Britons.

245
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:01,358
Don ‘t grovel. If there’s one thing 
I can ‘t stand, it’s people groveling.

246
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,158
- Sorry.
-And don’t apologize.

247
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:07,204
Evey time I talk to someone it’s
“sorry this,” and, “forgive me that''

248
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,906
and, “I’m not worthy. “

249
00:24:09,073 --> 00:24:11,792
-What are you doing now?
-I’m averting my eyes, O Lord.

250
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:16,418
Don‘t. It’s like those miserable psalms.
They’re so depressing.

251
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,374
-Now, knock it off’ Lord. -Yes,

252
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,961
Right. Arthur, King of the Britons.

253
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,172
Your knights of the Round Table
shall have a task

254
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,974
to make them an example
in these dark times.

255
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,769
-Good idea, O Lordl
-Course it’s a good idea.

256
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,191
Behold, Arthur, this is the Holy Grail’

257
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:40,063
Look well, Arthur,
for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.

258
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,732
That is your purpose, Arthur.

259
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:46,402
The quest for the Holy Grail.

260
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:54,418
-A blessing from the Lord.
-God be praised!

261
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,060
Halt!

262
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,148
Hello!

263
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,823
Hello!

264
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,080
Hello. Who is it?

265
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,005
It is King Arthur, and these are my knights of the Round Table.

266
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,711
Whose castle is this?

267
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:27,216
This is the castle of my master,
Guy de Loimbard.

268
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:31,383
Go and tell your master
that we have been charged by God

269
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,311
with a sacred quest. If he will give us
food and shelter for the night,

270
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,557
he can join us in our quest
for the Holy Grail.

271
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:43,064
Well, I’ll ask him,
but I don’t think he’ll be very keen.

272
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,233
He’s already got one, you see.

273
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,865
-What?
-Hi says they’ve already got one!

274
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:54,038
-Are you sure he’s got one?
-Oh, yes. It’s very nice.

275
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,078
I told him we’ve already got one.

276
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:04,545
-Can we come up and have a look?
-Of course not! You are English-types.

277
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,461
-Well, what are you then?
-I’m French.

278
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,549
Why do you think I have
this outrageous accent, you silly king?

279
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,222
-What are you doing in England?
-Mind your own business.

280
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:21,641
If you will not show us the Graill,
we shall take your castle by force.

281
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,897
You don’t frighten us, English pig-dogs!

282
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:29,444
Go and boil your bottoms,
sons of a silly person.

283
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,611
I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King.

284
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:37,911
You and all your silly English knights.

285
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:48,167
-What a strange person.
-Now look here, my good man...

286
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,628
I don’t want to talk to you no more

287
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,219
you empty-headed,
animal food-trough wiper.

288
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,343
I fart in your general direction

289
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:02,770
Your mother was a hamster,
and your father smelt of elderberries.

290
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,694
Is there someone else up there
we could talk to?

291
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,649
No. Now go away,
or I shall taunt you a second time.

292
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:17,701
Now, this is your last chance.
I’ve been more than reasonable...

293
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,243
-Fetchez Ia vache!
-Quoi?

294
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,791
Fetchez Ia vache!

295
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,289
If you do not agree to my commands,
then I shall..

296
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,466
Jesus Christ!

297
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,968
Crikey!

298
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,802
Right! Charge!

299
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,029
Run away!
Run away!

300
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,874
-Fiends! I’ll tear them apart.
-No, no.

301
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,919
Sir, I have a plan, sir.

302
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:46,519
-Un cadeau.
-What?

303
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:47,596
-A present.
-Un cadeau.

304
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,182
Oul, allons-y. Let’s go.

305
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,378
What happens now?

306
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:20,384
Well, now, Lancelot, Galahad,
and I wait until nightfall,

307
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,972
and then leap out of the rabbit, 
taking the French by surprise.

308
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,141
Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!

309
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,354
Who leaps out?

310
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,608
Lancelot, Galahad, and I

311
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,649
leap out of the rabbit.

312
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,655
Look. If we built this large,
wooden badger...

313
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,036
Run away!

314
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,386
-History for Schools. Take 8.
-Action!

315
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,686
Defeat at the castle seems to have 
utterly disheartened King Arthur.

316
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,811
The ferocity of the French taunting
took him completely by surprise.

317
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,191
Arthur became convinced
that a new strategy was required

318
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:22,733
if the quest for the Holy Grail were
to be brought to a successful conclusion.

319
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,702
Arthur, having consulted
his closest knights

320
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:30,370
decided that they should separate, 
and search for the Grail individually.

321
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,583
Now, this is what they did...

322
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:36,963
Frank!

323
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,471
So, each of the knights went their separate ways.

324
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:55,061
Sir Robin rode north,
through the dark forest of Ewing,

325
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,814
accompanied by his favorite minstrels.

326
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,781
Bravely bold Sir Robin 
Rode forth from Camelot

327
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:07,615
He was not afraid to die
O, Brave Sir Robin

328
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,911
He was not at all afraid 
To be killed in nasty ways

329
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,081
Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin

330
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:20,586
He was not in the least bit scared
To be mashed into a pulp

331
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,546
Or to have his eyes gouged out
And his elbows broken

332
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:29,679
To have his kneecaps split 
And his body burned away

333
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,186
And his limbs all hacked and mangled
Brave Sir Robin

334
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,732
His head smashed in 
And his heart cut out

335
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,729
His liver removed
And his bowels unplugged

336
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,778
His nostrils raped, his bottom burned off
And his penis...

337
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,777
That’s enough music for now, lads.

338
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,609
Looks like there’s dirty work afoot.

339
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,074
Anarcho-syndicalism
is a way of preserving freedom.

340
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:56,626
Dennis, forget about freedom.
Don’t drop that mud.

341
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:02,461
Halt! Who art thou?

342
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,502
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin...

343
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,882
Shut up!

344
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:11,016
Nobody, really. I was just passing through.

345
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,551
What do you want?

346
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,056
To fight and...

347
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,352
Shut up!

348
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:18,144
Nothing. Nothing, really.

349
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,399
-Just to pass through, good Sir Knight.
-I’m afraid not.

350
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:29,235
-Actually, I am a knight of the Round Table.
-You’re a knight of the Round Table?

351
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,698
I am.

352
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,996
-In that case, I have to kill you.
-Shall I?

353
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,290
-I don’t think so.
-What do I think?

354
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,208
-Kill him.
-Let’s be nice to him.

355
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:38,376
-Shut up.

356
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:39,498
And you!

357
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,580
Get the sword out.
I want to cut his head off!

358
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,507
-Cut your own head off
-Yes, do us all a favor.

359
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,631
-What?
-Yapping on all the time.

360
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,463
-You’re lucky you’re not next to him.
-What do you mean?

361
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:51,594
-You snore. 
-I don't.

362
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,972
-You’ve got bad breath.
-Only because you don’t brush my teeth.

363
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,429
Stop bitching, and let’s go and have tea!

364
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:01,642
All right! We’ll kill him first,
and then have tea and biscuits.

365
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,068
-Yes.
-Not biscuits.

366
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:06,613
All right! Not biscuits. 
But let’s kill him anyway

367
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,780
Right.

368
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,702
-He’s buggered off!
-So he has! He’s scarpered.

369
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,120
Brave Sir Robin ran away

370
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,196
No!

371
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,123
Bravely ran away, away

372
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,324
I didn’t.

373
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,125
When danger reared its ugly head 
He bravely turned his tail and fled

374
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:27,084
Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about 
And gallantly he chickened out

375
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:31,305
Bravely taking to his feet 
He beat a veiy brave retreat

376
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,381
Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin

377
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:34,637
I never!

378
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,772
Pie Jesu Domine

379
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:45,819
Dona els requiem

380
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,437
Open the door.

381
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,728
In the name of King Arthur, open the door!

382
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,825
Hello!

383
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:24,118
Welcome, gentle Sir Knight. 
Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.

384
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,746
-The Castle Anthrax?
-Yes.

385
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,836
It’s not a very good name, is it?

386
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:35,466
But we are nice, and we will attend
to your every, every need!

387
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,757
You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?

388
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,260
-The what?
-The Grail. It is here?

389
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,230
But you are tired, and you must rest awhile.

390
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,144
Midget! Crapper!

391
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,481
-Yes, O Zoot?
-Prepare a bed for our guest.

392
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,529
-Thank you, Zoot.
-Thank you.

393
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,319
Away, away, varletesses!

394
00:37:57,066 --> 00:38:01,196
The beds here are warm and soft,
and very, very big.

395
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,449
-Look, I...
-What is your name, handsome knight?

396
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,877
Sir Galahad the Chaste.

397
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,047
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot.

398
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:15,881
-But come.
-Please, in Gods name, show me the Grail.

399
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,098
You have suffered much. You are delirious.

400
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,926
-Look, I have seen it. It is here.
-Sir Galahad!

401
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,980
You would not be so ungallant
as to refuse our hospitality.

402
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:35,231
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull
and quiet, compared to yours.

403
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:41,203
We’re eight score blondes and brunettes,
all between 16 and 19 and a half,

404
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,664
cut off in this castle,
with no one to protect us.

405
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,329
It is a lonely Iife.

406
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:53,082
Bathing, dressing, undressing, 
making exciting underwear.

407
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,215
We are just not used to handsome knights.

408
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,138
Nay. Come. You may lie here.

409
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,721
-But you are wounded!
-No, it’s nothing!

410
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:09,810
You must see the doctors immediately.
Please, lie down.

411
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,651
-Well, what seems to be the trouble?
-They’re doctors?

412
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,116
They have a basic medical training.

413
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,199
Come, come, you must try to rest.

414
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,998
Dr. Piglet! Dr. Winston! Practice your art.

415
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,299
-Try to relax.
-Are you sure that’s absolutely necessary?

416
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,252
We must examine you.

417
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,592
-There’s nothing wrong with that.
-Please. We are doctors.

418
00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:49,604
Look, this cannot be.

419
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:52,436
-I am sworn to chastity!
-Back to your bedl

420
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,314
Torment me no longer. I have seen the Grail!

421
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,487
-There’s no Grail here.
-I have seen it.

422
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,111
-I have seen..
-Hello.

423
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,202
Hello.

424
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,681
Zoot!
-I am Zoot’s identical twin sister, Dingo.

425
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,605
-Where are you going?
-I seek the Grail.

426
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,944
I have seen it here in this castle!

427
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,400
Oh, no. Bad, bad Zoot!

428
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,078
-What is it?
-Wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!

429
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,791
She has been setting light to our beacon,
which is Grail-shaped.

430
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,544
It’s not the first time
we’ve had this problem.

431
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,337
Its not the real Grail?

432
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:59,545
Wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot.

433
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,011
She is a bad person,
and must pay the penalty.

434
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,965
Do you think this scene should have been cut?

435
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,927
We were so worried
when the boys were writing it.

436
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:13,354
But now we’re glad. It’s better
than some previous scenes, I think.

437
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,223
Ours was better visually.

438
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,059
Ours was committed.
It wasn’t a string of pussy jokes.

439
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,691
-Get on with it.
-Yes. Get on with it!

440
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,398
Get on with it!

441
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,737
-I am enjoying this scene.
-Get on with it!

442
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,537
Wicked,
wicked Zoot!

443
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,537
She must pay the penalty.

444
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:42,546
In Castle Anthrax, we have one punishment 
for setting alight the Grail-shaped beacon.

445
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,091
You must tie her down on a bed,
and spank her.

446
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,423
A spanking! A spanking!

447
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,514
You must spank her, and after you’ve spanked her, 
deal with her as you like.

448
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,891
-And, then, spank me.
-And me!

449
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,097
-And me.
-And me.

450
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,683
Yes. You must give us all a good spanking!

451
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,313
A spanking!

452
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:07,447
-And, after the spanking, the oral sex.
-The oral sex!

453
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,495
Well, I could stay a bit longer.

454
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,739
-Sir Galahad!
-Hello.

455
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,245
-Quick! You are in great peril.
-Why?

456
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,668
-No, he isn’t!
-Silence, foul temptress!

457
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:20,042
-She’s got a point.
-We’ll cover your escape!

458
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,874
-Look, I’m fine!
-Wait, Sir Galahad!

459
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:27,212
-I can tackle this lot single-handed
-Yes, let him tackle us single-handed!

460
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,722
No, Sir Galahad. Come!

461
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,141
Honestly, I can handle this lot easily!

462
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,844
-Yes, let him handle us easily.
-Go! Quick!

463
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:38,397
Wait! Please! I can defeat them!
There’s only 150 of them!

464
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,522
He’ll beat us easily. We haven’t a chance

465
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,898
Oh, shit!

466
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,034
-You were in great peril.
-I don’t think I was.

467
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:51,619
You were in terrible peril.

468
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,914
-Let me go back, and face the peril.
-No, it’s too perilous.

469
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,287
It’s my duty to sample as much peril as I can.

470
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,118
We’ve got to find the Holy Grail.

471
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:01,955
-Let me have just a bit of peril?
-No. It’s unhealthy.

472
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:04,086
-I bet you’re gay.
-No, I’m not.

473
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:09,387
Sir Lancelot had saved Sir Galahad
from almost certain temptation.

474
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,219
But, they were still no nearer the Grail.

475
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:16,182
King Arthur and Sir Bedevere,
not more than a swallow’s flight away,

476
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,183
had discovered something.

477
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:21,771
That’s an unladen swallow’s flight, obviously.

478
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,318
They were more than
two laden swallow’s flights away.

479
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,646
Four, with a coconut on a line between them.

480
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,356
If the birds were...

481
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,362
Get on with it!

482
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,442
Oh, anyway,

483
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:35,030
on to Scene 24, which is a smashing scene, 
with some lovely acting,

484
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,286
in which Arthur discovers a vital clue.

485
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:40,289
There aren‘t any swallows but I think you can hear a...

486
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:46,049
And this enchanter of whom you speak,
he has seen the Grail?

487
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:52,756
Where does he live?

488
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:54,557
Old man, where does he live?

489
00:43:55,883 --> 00:44:00,764
He knows of a cave.
A cave which no man has entered.

490
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:04,772
-And the Grail. The Grail is there?
-There is much danger.

491
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:09,489
For beyond the cave
lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril,

492
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,445
which no man has ever crossed.

493
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,323
But the Grail. Where is the Grail’?

494
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,116
Seek you the Bridge of Death.

495
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,419
The Bridge of Death? 
Which leads to the Grail?

496
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:13,716
-Who are you?
-We are the knights who say “Ni”!

497
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,343
-No! Not the knights who say “Ni’?
-The same!

498
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:20,177
-Who are they?
-We are the keepers of the sacred words.

499
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:24,063
“Ni", "Peng” and “Neee Wom”!

500
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,392
Those who hear them
seldom live to tell the tale.

501
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:31,855
The knights who say “Ni''
demand a sacrifice.

502
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:34,487
Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers

503
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,284
who seek the enchanter
who lives beyond these woods.

504
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,532
Ni! Ni!

505
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:49,043
We shall say “Ni” again to you,
if you do not appease us.

506
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,008
-What is it you want?
-We want

507
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,712
a shrubbery.

508
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,634
A what?

509
00:45:57,713 --> 00:46:01,843
-Ni! Ni!
-Please No more!

510
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:05,681
-We will find you a shrubbery.
-You must return with a shrubbery,

511
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,142
or else you will never pass
through this wood

512
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:11,064
alive.

513
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,775
Knights of Ni, you are just and fair.

514
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,733
-We will return with a shrubbery.
-One that looks nice.

515
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,784
-Of course.
-And not too expensive.

516
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,159
-Yes.
-Now go!

517
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,288
Stop that! Stop that!

518
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,295
Go on, clear off! Go away.

519
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:15,925
And you, clear off!

520
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,427
Bloody weather.

521
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:24,930
The tale of Sir Lancelot.

522
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:34,606
One day, lad, all this will be yours.

523
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,230
-What, the curtains?
-No, not the curtains.

524
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:41,784
All that you can see,
stretched out over the hills and valleys.

525
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,702
That'll be your kingdom, lad.

526
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,530
-But, Mother.
-Father, lad.

527
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:49,326
-But, Father, I dont want any of that.
-Listen, lad.

528
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:54,331
I built this kingdom up from nothing! 
When I started here, it was a swamp.

529
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:57,879
Other kings said I was daft
to build a castle on the swamp.

530
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,087
But I built it all the same to show them.

531
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,385
It sank into the swamp.

532
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,308
So, I built a second one.
That sank into the swamp.

533
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:10,230
I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank in the swamp.

534
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,306
But the fourth one stayed up.

535
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,234
And that’s what you’ll get, lad.

536
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:20,065
-The strongest castle in these isles.
-But I don’t want any of that.

537
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,446
-I'dd rather...
-Rather what?

538
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,652
I’d rather just

539
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:28,657
-sing.
-Stop that.

540
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,492
You’re not going into a song while I’m here!

541
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:33,915
In 20 minutes, you’re marrying a girl

542
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,999
whose father owns
the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.

543
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,918
-But I don’t want land.
-Listen, Alice.

544
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,594
-Herbert.
-Herbert.

545
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:46,095
We live on a bloody swamp,
we need all the land we can get.

546
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:49,518
-But I don’t like her.
-Don’t like her?

547
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,770
What’s wrong with her?

548
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:56,147
She’s beautiful, she’s rich. She’s got huge

549
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:58,273
tracts of land.

550
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,234
I know, but I want the girl
that I marry to have

551
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,662
a certain special something.

552
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,700
Cut that out!

553
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:17,539
You’re marrying Princess Lucky,
so you’d better get used to the idea!

554
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:19,965
Guards!

555
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,628
Make sure the Prince doesn’t leave
the room until I get him.

556
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,715
Not to leave the room,
even if you come and get him.

557
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,845
No. Until I come and get him.

558
00:49:29,175 --> 00:49:32,395
Until you come and get him, we’re not to enter the room.

559
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:37,358
No, you stay in the room
and make sure he doesn’t leave.

560
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,144
-And you’ll come and get him.
-Right.

561
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,902
We don't need to do anything,
apart from stop him entering the room.

562
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,319
-No. Leaving the room.
-Leaving the room, yes.

563
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,662
-All right?
-Right. If...

564
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:52,115
-If we’re....
-Yes?

565
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:56,001
Look, its quite simpIe.

566
00:49:56,076 --> 00:50:00,297
You stay here and make sure he doesn’t leave the room.

567
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,585
-All right? 
-I remember.

568
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,095
Can he leave the room with us?

569
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:10,345
No, you just keep him in here,
and make sure..

570
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,722
Yes! Well keep him in here, obviously.

571
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,975
-But if he had to leave...
-No. Keep him in here!

572
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:18,815
-Until you, or anyone.
-Not anyone, just mel

573
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,277
-Just you..
-Get back.

574
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,649
-Right?
-Right.

575
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,696
We’ll stay here until you get back.

576
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:27,616
-And make sure he doesn’t leave.
-What?

577
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:31,992
-Make sure he doesn’t leave.
-The Prince?

578
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,412
-Yes, make sure he doesn’t leave.
-Yes, of course!

579
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:37,164
I thought you meant him!

580
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:40,918
It seemed a bit daft
me having to guard him when he’s a guard.

581
00:50:41,330 --> 00:50:44,129
-Is that clear?
-Quite clear. No problems.

582
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:45,338
Right.

583
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,180
-Where are you going?
-We’re coming with you.

584
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:54,427
No, I want you to stay here,
and make sure he doesn’t leave.

585
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,144
I see, right.

586
00:50:56,971 --> 00:51:00,646
-But, Father...
-Shut it, and get that suit on.

587
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,325
And no singing!

588
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,661
Go and get a glass of water!

589
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,962
-Well taken, Concorde! 
-Thank you, sir, most kind.

590
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:05,540
And again!

591
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,968
Over we go! Good, steady!

592
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:11,262
Now, the big one!

593
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,135
Come on, Concorde!

594
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,385
Message for you, sir.

595
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,805
Concorde, speak to me!

596
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,155
“To whoever finds this note.

597
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:37,329
“I have been imprisoned by my father,

598
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:40,332
“who wishes me to marry against my will.

599
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,956
“Please, please come and rescue me.

600
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,922
''I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle''.

601
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:50,297
At last! A call! A cry of distress!

602
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:53,591
This could be the sign
that leads us to the Holy Grail!

603
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:58,268
Brave Concorde,
you shall not have died in vain!

604
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,310
I’m not quite dead, sir.

605
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,023
You shall not have been mortally wounded
in vain!

606
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,443
I think I could pull through, sir.

607
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,938
-l see.
-I think I’m all right to come with you.

608
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,773
No, sweet Concorde! Stay here.

609
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:16,030
I will send help as soon as
I have accomplished a daring and

610
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,863
heroic rescue in my own particular...

611
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,955
-Idiom, sir?
-Idiom!

612
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:27,497
-No, I feel fine, actually, sir.
-Farewell, sweet Concorde!

613
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:31,671
Ill just stay here, shall I, sir?

614
00:53:33,711 --> 00:53:34,837
Yeah.

615
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:15,344
-Morning.
-Morning.

616
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:01,215
Hey!

617
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,943
You’re not allowed to enter the room...

618
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,983
Fair one, behold your humble servant,
Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

619
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,990
-I have come to take... I’m terribly sorry.
-You got my note!

620
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:08,199
-I got a note.
-You’ve come to rescue me?

621
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:11,414
-Well, no, you see...
-I knew someone would.

622
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:16,333
I knew that somewhere out there,
there must be someone..

623
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,343
Stop that! Stop it!

624
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:21,879
Who are you?

625
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:23,589
-I’m your son.
-No, not you.

626
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,892
-Im Sir Lancelot, sir.
-Hes come to rescue me, Father.

627
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:31,188
-Let’s not jump to conclusions
-Did you kill all those guards?

628
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,103
Yes.
Sorry.

629
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,650
-They cost 50 pounds each.
-I’m awfully sorry.

630
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:39,822
Don’t be afraid of him, Sir Lancelot.
I’ve got a rope ready.

631
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:42,942
You killed eight wedding guests and all!

632
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,452
Well, you see,
I thought your son was a lady.

633
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,870
I can understand that.

634
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:49,289
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot! Hurry!
Shut up!

635
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:52,789
-You only killed the bride’s father!
-l didn’t mean to.

636
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,621
Didn’t mean to?
You put your sword through his head!

637
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,708
-Oh dear, is he all right?
-You kicked the bride in the chest!

638
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,293
-It’s going to cost me a fortune!
-I can explain.

639
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:05,176
I was in the forest, riding north
from Camelot, when I got this note.

640
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,883
-Are you from Camelot?
-Hurry, Sir Lancelot!

641
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,102
I'm a knight of King Arthur, sir.

642
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,181
Very nice castle, Camelot.
Very good pig country.

643
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,980
-Is it?
-I am ready!

644
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:20,814
-Would you like to come have a drink?
-Thats awfully nice of you.

645
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:24,320
-I am ready!
-I mean, to be so understanding.

646
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:28,324
You see, when I’m in this idiom, 
I sometimes get a bit carried away.

647
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:38,463
Now, this is the main hall.
We’ll have all this knocked through...

648
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:42,042
-There he is!
-Bloody hell.

649
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:55,390
-Hold it, please!
-See what I mean? I get carried away.

650
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:58,396
I'm really most awfully sorry.
Sorry, everyone.

651
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,897
He’s killed the best man!

652
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:05,942
Hold it, please, hold it! 
This is Sir Lancelot

653
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:11,030
from the Court of CameIot, a brave and influential knigh.

654
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,659
-And my special guest here today.
-Hallo.

655
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,368
He killed my auntie!

656
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,750
No, please!
This is supposed to be a happy occasion!

657
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:25,798
Let’s not bicker and argue
about who killed who.

658
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:31,092
We are here today to witness the union
of two young people

659
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,560
in the joyful bond of holy wedlock.

660
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:38,937
Unfortunately, one of them,
my son Herbert,

661
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,773
has just fallen to his death.

662
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:46,106
But I don’t want to think I’ve lost a son,
so much as

663
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,279
gained a daughter.

664
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:52,238
For, since the tragic death of her father..

665
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,448
He’s not quite dead!

666
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,831
Since the near fatal wounding of her father..

667
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,704
He’s getting better!

668
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:05,967
For, since her own father

669
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,429
who, when he seemed about to recover,

670
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,308
suddenly felt the icy hand of death
upon him.

671
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,431
He’s died!

672
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:19,557
I want his only daughter to look upon me

673
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:24,145
as her own dad, in a very real,
and legally binding sense.

674
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:30,655
And I feel sure that the merger, the union between the Princess

675
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:35,114
and the brave but dangerous Sir Lancelot of Camelot...

676
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,659
-What?
-Look, the dead Prince!

677
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:44,832
-He’s not quite dead! 
-I feel much betteri

678
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,835
You fell out of the tall tower, you creep!

679
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,881
-No, I was saved at the last minute.
-How?

680
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:53,845
I’ll tell you.

681
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:57,678
Not like that! Not like that.

682
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:01,524
He’s going to tell 
He’s going to tell

683
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,817
Quickly, sir, come this way!

684
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:11,821
No, it’s not right for my idiom.
I must escape more...

685
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,867
-Dramatically, sir?
-Dramatically.

686
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:31,841
Excuse me,
could somebody give me a push, please?

687
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:49,275
Old crone!

688
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:54,401
Is there anywhere in this town
where we could buy a shrubbery?

689
01:00:55,235 --> 01:00:58,739
-Who sent you?
-The knights who say “Ni”!

690
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,704
No! We have no shrubberies here.

691
01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:05,913
If you do not tell us where we can buy
a shrubbery, my friend and I

692
01:01:06,288 --> 01:01:07,585
will say...

693
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,592
We will say “Ni.”

694
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,507
Do your worst!

695
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:17,763
Very well.
If you will not assist us voluntarily...

696
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:22,600
-Ni!
-No!

697
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,641
Never. No shrubberies.

698
01:01:25,974 --> 01:01:27,726
-Ni!
-No!

699
01:01:27,976 --> 01:01:30,274
No, it’s not that, it’s ‘Ni.”

700
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:33,482
No, you’re not doing it properly.

701
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,109
-Ni!
-You've got it.

702
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,203
-Ni!
-Ni!

703
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,407
Are you saying “Ni” to that old woman?

704
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:43,708
Yes.

705
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:48,710
What sad times are these when passing 
ruffians can say “Ni” at will to old ladies.

706
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:52,463
There is a pestilence upon this land.
Nothing is sacred.

707
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,592
Even those who arrange shrubberies
are under considerable economic stress

708
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,673
at this period in history.

709
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,472
-Did you say ''shrubberies''?
-Yes.

710
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,597
Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber.

711
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:09,310
My name is Roger the Shrubber.
I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.

712
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:12,320
-Ni!
-No!

713
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:16,237
Knights of Ni,
we have brought you your shrubbery.

714
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,660
-May we go?
-It is a good shrubbery.

715
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:23,206
I like the laurels particularly.
But there is one small problem.

716
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:24,908
What is that?

717
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:29,337
We are now no longer the knights who say “Ni.

718
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,256
We are now the knights who say,

719
01:02:32,332 --> 01:02:35,836
“Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing”!

720
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,881
Therefore, we must give you a test.

721
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:42,559
What is this test,
knights who until recently said “Ni’?

722
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,474
Firstly, you must find

723
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,897
another shrubbery!

724
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:51,526
Not another shrubbery!

725
01:02:51,643 --> 01:02:55,364
Then you must bring it here
beside this shrubbery.

726
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:59,113
Higher, so you get the two-level effect 
with a path going down the middle.

727
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,240
A path! A path!

728
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:04,490
Then, when you have found
the shrubberies,

729
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:08,164
you must cut down
the mightiest tree in the forest

730
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:12,042
with a herring!

731
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,005
-We shall do no such thing.
-Please.

732
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:19,550
Cut down a tree with a herring?
It can’t be done.

733
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,133
-Don’t say that word.
-What word?

734
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,218
I cannot tell. Suffice to say,

735
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,017
it’s one of the words
the knights of Ni cannot hear.

736
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:31,020
How can we not say the word
if you don’t tell us what it is?

737
01:03:31,099 --> 01:03:33,227
-He did it again.
-What? "Is"?

738
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,864
No, not “is”! You wouldn’t get 
very far in life not saying “is.”

739
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,441
My liege, it’s Robin.

740
01:03:39,566 --> 01:03:43,946
He’s jacking it in and packing it up
And sneaking away and buggering off

741
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,667
And chickening out and pissing a pot
Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge

742
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:49,994
-Robin.
-My liege.

743
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,669
-It’s good to see you.
-Now he’s said the word!

744
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:54,339
You haven’t given up your quest
for the Holy Grail?

745
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:55,757
He is sneaking away and...

746
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:56,924
Shut up!

747
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,920
-No, far from it.
-You said the word again.

748
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:04,600
I was looking for it here in this forest.

749
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:09,104
-No, it is far from this place.
-Stop saying the word!

750
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,689
-The word we cannot hear!
-Stop it!

751
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,850
-He said ''it'' again!
-That's it!

752
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,937
I’ve said ‘‘it". I've said "it".
I’ve said ''it'' again!

753
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:19,281
That’s three “its’!

754
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:29,951
And so Arthur and Bedevere and
Sir Robin set out on their search to find

755
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:33,958
the enchanter of whom
the old man had spoken in Scene 24.

756
01:04:35,455 --> 01:04:38,299
Beyond the forest
they met Lancelot and Galahad,

757
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,794
and there was much rejoicing.

758
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,558
In the frozen land of Nador,

759
01:04:54,641 --> 01:04:57,440
they were forced to eat Robin’s minstrels.

760
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,356
And there was much rejoicing.

761
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:03,654
A year passed.

762
01:05:07,487 --> 01:05:09,956
Winter changed into spring.

763
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,618
Spring changed into summer.

764
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,582
Summer changed back into winter,

765
01:05:15,662 --> 01:05:20,213
and winter gave spring and summer
a miss and went straight on into autumn.

766
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:22,753
Until one day.

767
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,326
Knights,

768
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:48,824
forward!

769
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,451
What manner of man are you
that can summon up fire

770
01:06:28,526 --> 01:06:32,952
-without flint or tinder?
-I am an enchanter.

771
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:39,838
-By what name are you known?
-There are some who call me...

772
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,589
-Tim.
-Greetings, Tim the enchanter!

773
01:06:44,709 --> 01:06:47,087
Greetings, King Arthur.

774
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,594
-You know my name?
-I do.

775
01:06:57,597 --> 01:07:00,350
You seek the Holy Grail.

776
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:04,029
That is our quest.
You know much that is hidden, Tim.

777
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,355
Quitel

778
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,036
Yes, we are looking for the Holy Grail.

779
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:20,207
-Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.
-Yes, it is.

780
01:07:23,414 --> 01:07:26,634
-And so we’re looking for it.
-Yes, we are.

781
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,595
-We have been for some time.
-Ages.

782
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:36,641
So, anything you could do to help 
would be

783
01:07:39,097 --> 01:07:40,223
very

784
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:44,318
-helpful.
-Look, can you tell us where...

785
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,151
Fine, I don’t want to waste
any more of your time,

786
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:55,156
but I don’t suppose you could tell us
where we might find a...

787
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,910
A what?

788
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,671
A grail?

789
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,919
Yes, I think so.

790
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:07,504
Yes.

791
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:09,840
Yes!

792
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,849
-Thank you.
-Splendid!

793
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:21,272
Look, you’re a busy man...

794
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:26,023
Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.

795
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:31,278
To the north, there lies a cave.
The Cave of Caerbannog.

796
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:35,703
Wherein, carved in mystic runes,
upon the very living rock,

797
01:08:36,154 --> 01:08:39,499
the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged

798
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:46,545
make plain the last resting place
of the most Holy Grail.

799
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:50,552
-Where could we find this cave, Tim?
-Follow!

800
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,141
But follow only if ye be men of valor.

801
01:08:56,549 --> 01:09:00,019
For the entrance to this cave
is guarded by a creature

802
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:03,731
so foul,
so cruel,

803
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:07,068
that no man yet has fought with it and lived.

804
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:13,651
Bones of full 50 men lie strewn
about its lair.

805
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:18,572
So, brave knights,
if you do doubt your courage

806
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:21,916
or your strength, come no further,

807
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:27,213
for death awaits you all
with nasty, big, pointy teeth.

808
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,543
What an eccentric performance!

809
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:46,520
They’re nervous, sire.

810
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:49,193
Then we’d best leave them here
and carry on, on foot.

811
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,770
Dismount!

812
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:07,913
Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!

813
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:13,460
-Right, keep me covered.
-What with?

814
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,588
-Just keep me covered.
-Too late.

815
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,094
There he is!

816
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,349
-Where?
-There.

817
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:28,437
-What, behind the rabbit?
-It is the rabbit.

818
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,029
-You silly sod!
-What?

819
01:10:33,104 --> 01:10:34,572
You got us all worked up.

820
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,365
That’s no ordinary rabbit.

821
01:10:36,441 --> 01:10:41,413
Thats the most foul, cruel and
bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.

822
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:45,201
You tit! I soiled my armor I was so scared!

823
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:48,828
Look, that rabbit’s got
a vicious streak a mile wide.

824
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,913
-It’s a killer!
-Get stuffed.

825
01:10:50,997 --> 01:10:53,341
-He’ll do you up a treat, mate!
-Yeah?

826
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,965
-You manky Scots git!
-I’m warning you.

827
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:59,718
-What’s he do? Nibble your bum?
-He’s got huge, sharp...

828
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,509
It can leap about...

829
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:06,392
-Look at the bones!
-Go on, Bors, chop its head off.

830
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:10,233
Right. Silly little bleeder.
One rabbit stew coming right up.

831
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,070
Look!

832
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:20,113
-Jesus Christ!
-I warned you!

833
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,287
-I’ve done it again.
-I warned you.

834
01:11:22,361 --> 01:11:25,706
But did you listen to me?
No, you knew it all, didn’t you?

835
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:30,416
It’s just a harmless little bunny, isn’t it?
Well, it’s always the same.

836
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:33,123
-I always...
-Shut up!

837
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,425
Charge!

838
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,569
Run away!

839
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,994
-How many did we lose?
-Gawain.

840
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:09,121
-Ector.
-And Bors. That’s five.

841
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,168
-Three.
-Three.

842
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:15,211
We better not risk another frontal assault,
that rabbit’s dynamite.

843
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:17,917
Would it help to confuse it
if we run away more?

844
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,379
-Shut up and change your armor.
-Let us taunt it.

845
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:24,261
lit may become so cross
that it will make a mistake.

846
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,466
Like what?

847
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:27,806
Well...

848
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:32,940
-Have we got bows?
-No.

849
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:35,393
-We have the Holy Hand Grenade.
-Yes, of course!

850
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,228
The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch.

851
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,155
It’s one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries.

852
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:43,326
Brother Maynard!
Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.

853
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,104
How does it...

854
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:17,981
How does it work?

855
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,904
-l know not, my liege.
-Consult the Book of Armaments.

856
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:24,780
Armaments 2: 9-21.

857
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:32,037
“And St. Attila raised the hand grenade
up on high, saying,

858
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:36,872
“O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade,
that with it thou mayest

859
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:40,629
“blow thine enemies
to tiny bits, in thy mercy''.

860
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,387
“And the Lord did grin
and the people did feast upon

861
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:49,434
“the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans

862
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,390
“and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and..''

863
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:53,972
Skip a bit, Brother.

864
01:13:55,765 --> 01:14:00,521
“The Lord spake, saying,
‘First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin,

865
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:05,780
“then shalt thou count to three,
no more, no less.

866
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:09,366
“Three shalt be the number
thou shalt count,

867
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,449
''and the number
of the counting shalt be three.

868
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:16,662
“Four shalt thou not count,
neither count thou two,

869
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:19,877
''excepting that thou then proceed to three.

870
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:23,551
“Five is right out.

871
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:28,214
“Once the number three,
being the third number be reached,

872
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,885
“then lobbest thou
thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch

873
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:35,730
“towards thy foe,
who, being naughty in my sight,

874
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,062
“shall snuff it.”

875
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:41,147
Amen.

876
01:14:41,227 --> 01:14:42,319
Right.

877
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,232
One, two, five!

878
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,191
-Three, sir! Three!

879
01:15:33,154 --> 01:15:34,656
There! Look!

880
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,951
-What does it say?
-What language is that?

881
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,287
Brother Maynard, you’re our scholar.

882
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:42,000
It is Aramaic!

883
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,208
Of course. Joseph of Arimathea!

884
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,635
-Of course.
-What does it say?

885
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:51,097
It reads, “Here may be found

886
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:54,802
“the last words of Joseph of Arimathea

887
01:15:55,509 --> 01:15:58,763
He who is valiant and pure of spirit

888
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,774
‘may find the Holy Grail

889
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:06,400
“in the Castle of Aaargh.’’

890
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,486
What?

891
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:14,078
“The Castle of Aaargh.”

892
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:15,989
What is that?

893
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:18,749
He must have died while carving it.

894
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:21,668
-Come on!
-Thats what it says.

895
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,381
Look, if he was dying,
he wouldn’t bother to carve “Aaargh.”

896
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,006
-He’d just say it.
-That’s what’s carved in the rock.

897
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,378
-Perhaps he was dictating it.
-Shut up!

898
01:16:31,462 --> 01:16:33,760
-Does it say anything else?
-No!

899
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:37,093
Just “Aaargh.”

900
01:16:39,053 --> 01:16:41,476
Aaargh.

901
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:45,310
Do you suppose he meant the Camargue?

902
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:47,394
-Where’s that?
-In France, I think.

903
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:52,279
-Isn’t there a St. Aaargh’s in Cornwall?
-No, that’s St. Ives.

904
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,739
St. Ives.

905
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:59,453
No, “Aaargh.” At the back of the throat.

906
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:02,661
No, ‘Ooh,’ in surprise and alarm!

907
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:05,663
-You mean a sort of an “Ah!”
-Yes, that’s right.

908
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,374
My God!

909
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,884
It’s the legendary Black Beast ...

910
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:19,143
That’s it! Run away!

911
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,396
Keep running.

912
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:36,489
We’ve lost him.

913
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:41,032
As the horrendous Black Beast
lunged foiward,

914
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:44,539
escape for Arthur
and his knights seemed hopeless.

915
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:48,623
When, suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.

916
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:51,550
The cartoon peril was no more.

917
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:55,213
The quest for the Holy Grail could continue.

918
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,976
There it is!

919
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:13,447
-The Bridge of Death.
-Great.

920
01:18:13,606 --> 01:18:16,576
Look! There’s the old man from Scene 24.

921
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:20,405
-What’s he doing here?
-He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.

922
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:23,249
He asks each traveler five questions.

923
01:18:23,324 --> 01:18:25,292
-Three questions!
-Three questions.

924
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,962
-He who answers the five questions...
-Three questions.

925
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:33,509
-... three questions, may cross in safety.
-What if you get a question wrong?

926
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:37,088
Then you are cast
into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.

927
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:40,512
-Oh, wacko.
-Who’s going to answer the questions?

928
01:18:40,633 --> 01:18:43,477
Brave Sir Robin, you go.

929
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,222
I’ve got a great idea.

930
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:48,394
Why doesn’t Lancelot go?

931
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:51,227
Yes, let me go, my liege.
I will take him single-handed.

932
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,985
-I shall make a feint to the northeast...
-Hang on!

933
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:57,817
-Just answer the five questions...
-Three questions.

934
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:01,905
...three questions, as best you can.
And we shall watch and pray.

935
01:19:02,112 --> 01:19:03,955
I understand, my liege.

936
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:07,828
Good luck, brave Sir Lancelot.
God be with you.

937
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:13,336
Stop!

938
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:19,548
Who would cross the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

939
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,932
Ere the other side he see.

940
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,136
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I’m not afraid.

941
01:19:25,386 --> 01:19:29,311
-What is your name?
-My name is Sir Lancelot of Camelot.

942
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:31,809
What is your quest?

943
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:34,107
To seek the Holy Grail.

944
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,731
What is your favorite color?

945
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:39,442
-Blue.
-Right. Off you go.

946
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:42,824
Well, thank you very much.

947
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:48,500
That’s easy.

948
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:52,584
Stop.

949
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:58,006
Who approacheth the Bridge of Death,
must answer me these questions three.

950
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,596
Ere the other side he see.

951
01:20:01,422 --> 01:20:04,175
Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper.
I’m not afraid.

952
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:07,888
-What is your name?
-Sir Robin of Camelot.

953
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:11,474
-What is your quest? 
-To seek the Holy Grail.

954
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,935
What is the capital of Assyria?

955
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:18,067
I don’t know that!

956
01:20:26,822 --> 01:20:27,914
Stop!

957
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:32,374
-What is your name?
-Sir Galahad of Camelot.

958
01:20:32,578 --> 01:20:36,003
-What is your quest?
-I seek the Grail.

959
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:40,010
-What is your favorite color?
-Blue.

960
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:41,883
No! Yellow!

961
01:20:49,345 --> 01:20:50,392
Stop!

962
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:54,692
-What is your name?
-It is Arthur, King of the Britons.

963
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,775
-What is your quest? 
-To seek the Holy Grail.

964
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,950
What is the air-speed velocity
of an unladen swallow?

965
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:06,613
What do you mean?
An African or European swallow?

966
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,115
I don’t know that!

967
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:17,790
How do you know so much about swallows?

968
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:20,589
You have to know these things
when you’re a king.

969
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:01,504
Lancelot!

970
01:22:07,965 --> 01:22:09,012
Lancelot!

971
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,193
Lancelot!

972
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:13,140
The Castle Aaargh. Our quest is at an end.

973
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:33,410
God be praised.

974
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,411
Almighty God,

975
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:42,415
we thank thee, that thou hast vouchsafed
to us the most holy...

976
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,624
Jesus Christ!

977
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,086
Hello, stuffy English knights

978
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:53,092
and Monsieur Arthur King,
who has the brain of a duck, you know.

979
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:56,220
So, we French fellows 
outwit you a second time.

980
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:59,304
How dare you profane this place
with your presence?

981
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:03,770
I command you,
in the name of the knights of Camelot,

982
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,986
to open the doors of this sacred castlel

983
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:10,655
to which God himself has guided us.

984
01:25:10,856 --> 01:25:15,862
How you English say? One more time,
I unclog my nose in your direction,

985
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:17,621
Sons of a window-dresser!

986
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,290
So, you think you couId out-clever us French folk

987
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:23,960
with your silly knees-bent,
running about, advancing behavior.

988
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,835
I wave my private parts at your aunties.

989
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:31,719
You cheesy lot of second-hand electric donkey-bottom biters!

990
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,887
In the name of the Lord,

991
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:37,725
we demand entrance to this sacred castle!

992
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:40,640
No chance, English bed-wetting types.

993
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:44,974
I burst my pimples at you, and call your
door-opening request a silly thing!

994
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:48,482
You tiny-brained wipers of other people’s bottoms.

995
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:52,235
If you’ll not open this door,
we shall take this castle by force!

996
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:56,569
In the name of God and the glory of our...

997
01:25:58,236 --> 01:26:00,739
Right! That settles it!

998
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:04,668
Depart at this time,
and donut be approaching any more,

999
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:09,499
or we fire arrows into your heads,
and make castanets out of your testicles.

1000
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:11,174
Walk away, just ignore them.

1001
01:26:11,249 --> 01:26:15,220
And now remain gone,
illegitimate-faced bugger-folk!

1002
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:20,013
And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you ain’t heard

1003
01:26:20,092 --> 01:26:23,596
nothing yet, stuffy English knights!

1004
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:48,579
-We shall attack at once.
-Yes, my liege.

1005
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,622
Stand by for attack!

1006
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,687
French persons!

1007
01:27:52,601 --> 01:27:56,356
Today the blood of many a valiant knight
shall be avenged.

1008
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,283
In the name of God,
we shall not stop our fight

1009
01:28:00,358 --> 01:28:05,159
till each one of you lies dead,
and the Holy Grail

1010
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,875
returns to those whom God has chosen.

1011
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:13,331
Charge!

1012
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:41,403
Yes, they’re the ones, I’m sure.

1013
01:28:47,072 --> 01:28:49,700
-Come on.
-Put this man in the van.

1014
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,422
-Put him in the van.
-Get a blanket over that one.

1015
01:28:56,706 --> 01:28:59,255
Come on, back! Right back!

1016
01:29:01,503 --> 01:29:03,756
That’s an offensive weapon, that is

1017
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,348
All right, sonny, that’s enough. Pack that in.
